# web2web-gateway
See [live demo](https://elendirx.github.io/web2web-gateway) for more info.

## Install
It's super-easy to run your own gateway. Just pick the `index.html`, upload it to your server or simply open it from `localhost`.
It even runs in [JS Fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/36840ejb).


Or create your own build with [browserify](http://browserify.org).
